             I’m a  professional at playing  Basketball and Badmintion . I hail from the Aleppy district and I’ve been playing the sport for the past seven years. My life is all about the practice that I put into it and the dream that I’m doing all this for. I lead a disciplined life trying to balance my training, fitness, and diet all at once. Here’s a day in my life.<BR>
            
            5:00 AM: Just got up, going for my morning run. This is a 5-kilometer run and the first of the day. <BR>
            
            7:45 AM: It’s time for some heavy breakfast. Not too heavy though because after this I need to play for about two hours. The district level rankings are just around the corner.<BR>
            
            8:30 AM: I’m at the stadium now for my morning practice routines. Here I spend two hours each morning working on my forehand push and backhand push.
            
            It amuses me when people who are completely new to the game try difficult serves and top-spins for hardly one week before deciding that the sport isn’t for them. I’ve been practicing for seven years and I still find it difficult.<BR>
            
            10:30 AM: After a shower, I leave for college to attend my classes. I’m pursuing a B.tech in Amrita Vidyalaya .<BR>
            
            1:30 PM: College just got over and I’m going to dome to take lunch and then rest for a while. It isn’t so much an afternoon siesta as it is a few minutes of muscle relaxation. I need this because of the rigorous training session that’s coming in a few hours.<BR>
            
            4:00 PM: I’m at the stadium again. Starting to limber up for the second and more extensive practice session of the day. I will begin by making the newcomer practice and introducing them to basic strokes of Basketball.
            
            It often tests your patience because it’s hard for them to get it right at first, but as a senior and guide, even that teaches you to have patience.<BR>
            
            6:00 PM: I’m done with the juniors. Now it’s time to get my lob practice routines. I have a buddy at the other end who’s giving me easy services, and my job is to return with a lob shot that’s measured, controlled, and steady. Many won’t believe the amount of practice that it takes to get this basic skill perfect.<BR>
            
            6:30 PM: The rubber that I use for my bat is corroding. I need to order a new one as I need more spin in my forehand top spins.
            
            I’ve been using the same bat for the past several years, and I’ve come to have an emotional attachment to it, Hence, I take good care of it.<BR>
            
            7:30 PM: My colleagues and I will begin playing matches amongst ourselves now to prepare ourselves for the upcoming rankings. Also, my t-shirt is drenched in sweat. Need a change.
            
            At this point, it has ceased to be practice and started being entertainment. We’re laughing and enjoying ourselves to the fullest. After an hour of this, or two, we’ll call it a day.</P>
